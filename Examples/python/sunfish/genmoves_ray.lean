The RAY, round by round and leaf by leaf — the remainder of **L4**
(docs/generator-tier-architecture.md §4; docs/backlog.md §"L4 PARTIAL"
prices what is here and says why it is a separate module).

`genmoves_theorem.lean` landed the ray's FIRST agreement leaf,
`ray_stop_agrees`: the shipped `Position.gen_moves`, suspended in a ray at
the `count` object holding `j`, on a board whose square `j` the reference
reads as a blocker, emits exactly what `Ref.ray` reports (nothing). This
file carries that from one leaf to the whole ray, and its two halves are
not the same kind of work:

* the remaining **leaves** are settled in shape — project the statement,
  run it at a symbolic board, splice the frame rule — and each costs one
  ~20 s captured `py_simp` over the `sunfish` module literal, which is why
  they live here rather than growing `genmoves_theorem.lean`;
* the **round induction** is the piece with no precedent in the tier, and
  it is the reason the file exists. From the unconditional `yield` on, the
  ray CONTINUES, so agreement stops being a leaf fact and becomes an
  invariant carried across rounds.

**What the round induction turned out to be.** It is NOT an induction over
the generator. `count(i + d, d)` never exhausts, so the model side has no
remainder list to recurse on and `GenEmits.forGenDone` is unreachable — the
only thing that ends a ray is a `break`. The induction is therefore over
the REFERENCE's fuel, and the model side rides along as a
continuation-passing round transformer (`RayRound`): each round proves "I
emit `out`, and whatever the loop frame emits AFTER me, I prepend `out` to
it". Composition is then function composition, `GenEmits.forGenRound` is
its introduction rule, and the ray's end is any round that never calls its
continuation.

That split is what makes `ray_rounds` provable without a single `py_simp`:
it is pure `Except`/`List` reasoning over `rayBody_append_or_const`, and it
takes the model side entirely as hypotheses. The two hypotheses are exactly
the two arms of that characterization — a round that ENDS the ray and a
round that CONTINUES it — so discharging them is precisely the leaf work,
and nothing about the induction moves when a leaf lands.

/-! ## The rest of the ray, projected

`genmoves_theorem.lean` projected `rQ` and `rStop` off the shipped AST and
pinned each with an `rfl`; `rRest` is the five statements after them. Same
discipline here: nothing is retyped, so a changed PROGRAM stops the `rfl`s
loudly instead of quietly proving a theorem about a stale ray. -/

/-! ## The reference's leaf dichotomy, strengthened

`rayBody_map_or_const` (genmoves_theorem.lean) says every leaf of the ray
body is either constant in the tail or `g <$> tail`. The induction needs
one notch more: the tail-consuming leaf PREPENDS a fixed list, and it is
that `pre ++ ·` shape — not an arbitrary `g` — that lets
`ms.map moveVal` split into the round's output and the rest of the ray's.
Same proof: unfold, split every guard, and each leaf closes by `rfl` on one
side or the other, with `pre` read off by unification. -/

/-! ## One ROUND, in continuation-passing form

The model side of a round cannot be stated as "it emits `out` and lands in
state `st₂`", because a `break` in the middle of the body leaves the loop
frame too and there is no `st₂` at the loop altitude to land in. What holds
uniformly is the CPS form below: a round is a transformer on the rest of
the ray's emission. `RayRound` is that transformer for a round that goes
again; a round that ends the ray is just a `GenEmits` outright, which is
what `ray_stop_agrees` already is. -/

/-- **A ray round that CONTINUES**: from `st`, the loop frame emits `out`
and then behaves exactly as the loop frame does from `st₂`. -/

    GenEmits sunfish st [.forGen gmRayTarget a gmRay] (out ++ ws) st₃

/-- The introduction rule: step the `count` object, bind `j`, run the body
to a fall-through. This is `GenEmits.forGenRound` with its continuation
left free — which is the whole trick that turns the ray into a fold. -/

    (hbody : GenEmits sunfish ⟨w', env₁⟩ [.block gmRay] out st₂) :
    RayRound a out st st₂ :=

/-! ## The ROUND INDUCTION -/

set_option maxHeartbeats 800000 in
/-- **The round induction** — L4's remainder, and the fact L5 consumes.

Given an invariant `Inv j st` that holds when the ray is about to run its
round at square `j`, and an exit condition `Out`:

* whenever the reference's body at `j` is CONSTANT in its tail (the ray
  ENDS there), the generator emits that constant and stops — `hstop`;
* whenever it prepends a fixed `pre` and recurses (the ray CONTINUES), the
  generator emits `pre` and re-establishes the invariant one square along
  — `hgo`;

then the generator agrees with `Ref.ray` at EVERY square, at every fuel,
for the whole ray.

The induction is on the reference's fuel, not on the generator: `count`
never exhausts, so the model side has no decreasing measure and
`GenEmits.forGenDone` is unreachable on a ray. Nothing here runs a
statement — the model side enters entirely through `hstop`/`hgo` and
`RayRound`'s composition — so this theorem does not move when a leaf lands,
and the leaves can land one at a time. -/
