# The python-completeness lane's backlog

Per-lane backlog, per `docs/family-architecture.md` §9.5. **Appended only by
the python-completeness lane.** Ids are `YYYY-MM-DD-pycomplete-<n>` and need
no reservation, because the lane name makes them unique — which this lane can
attest to the value of: its rung-3b landing was written as §L59, renumbered to
§L74, then to §L85, and never landed under any of them, because each number
was taken while the lane sat in the build queue.

**Everything before 2026-08-22 is in `docs/backlog.md`** and stays there; this
lane's history is §L39 (the founding census), §L49 (rung 1), §L51 (rung 2) and
§L53 (rung 3's census), and every one of those references keeps resolving.

The lane's charter is `docs/completeness.md`: close the extractor/interpreter
refusal surface toward ARBITRARY Python, censused before priced and priced
before built. `harness/refusal_census.py` is the scoreboard and the acceptance
battery in one — it exits nonzero on drift, so a landing that moves the tier
must move the census in the same commit.

## 2026-08-22-pycomplete-1 — RUNG 3b: the eight consumers that could never meet the hazard their refusal cited

`list(d)`, `tuple(d)`, `sorted(d)`, `sum(d)`, `max(d)`, `min(d)`, `set(d)`,
`any(d)`, `all(d)` and `[*d]` all run, over the keys, in CPython's insertion
order. **Eight of the ten refusal messages §L39 hung rung 3 on are gone**, and
the grammar census moves **68 → 74 MATCH of 105**.
docs/memory-model.md §the draining consumers, as built.

### The finding this inch exists to prove

§L53 measured that these consumers **drain the keys with no user code running
in between**, so not one of the three mutation regimes — value update, size
change, same-size key-set churn — can arise inside them. Their refusals all
cited "live dict iteration; docs/memory-model.md", a blanket doctrine
inherited from the H1 decision to keep the live cursor out. **A refusal
inherits its REASON as readily as its text**, and only running each consumer
separately separated them.

What they needed was one line — `dictKeys es = es.map Prod.fst`, the entries
array being the insertion sequence already — plus seven value arms, each the
`.list` arm sitting beside it in the same `match`.

### The price was 19 walker arms, and §L53 called it

The census recorded the risk before the inch was written: *"`PayloadBlind`'s
swap-blindness lemmas must be shown to hold for the new dict arms… §L49's
`evalUnaryOpH_swapAt` is the standing reminder that an exhaustive `cases` can
hide behind a grep."* It fired, and wider than for one operator:

| walker | arms | why it broke |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ClockErase` | 12 | `cases obj <;> try exact .unsupported` — the `try` silently absorbed the dict arm while it refused, and leaves the goal open once it decides |
| `PayloadBlind` | 7 | `\| _ => exact PBF.unsupported` catch-alls, plus the two `sortedValH` helper lemmas (`_swapAt`, `_slot`) whose `\| _ =>` arms had the same shape |

Every one is the adjacent `.list` arm's tactic verbatim. **The rule §L49
started now sharpens:** a change that makes a previously-REFUSING arm DECIDE
costs exactly as many proof arms as there are walkers whose catch-all was
leaning on that refusal. A refusal is not free in the proof layer — it is a
case someone else is standing on.

Payload-blindness holds structurally: a `PayloadTwin` is `.generator …
.running` on BOTH sides, so the swapped slot can never hold a dict; the new
arms read entries at an address the twin cannot be.

### The regression guard that flipped IS the acceptance signal

`Examples/python/star_lab/spec.lean` asserted `star_dict` refuses. `[*d]` now
answers CPython's `['x', 'y']`, so the build failed on that `#guard` — the
`%`-formatting landing's signal, at the one pre-existing expectation this inch
moves. It became a `#py_check` of the real value and its `cases.json` row
moved `unsupported` → `match`.

### What did NOT move, deliberately

The live cursor (`for k in d`, inch 3a) is untouched, and
`dict_lab.keys_for_is_still_loud` is the row that says so. The view methods
and `enumerate(d)` are inch 3c. The same-size churn regime stays
**permanently loud**, with §L53's cross-rung note standing: it is unreachable
today only because `del d[k]` refuses first, and becomes REQUIRED the day dict
deletion lands.

### THE OPERATIONAL LESSONS, paid for in full

This inch was built, verified green, and LOST — `/private/tmp` purged with the
commit unpushed while the lane queued on the build lock. It was rebuilt from
the recipe §L53 had already pushed: **the census survived because the census
was pushed.** Then it was nearly lost a second way, and that one is worth more
than the first:

* **`origin` in the seeded clones is a STALE LOCAL BUNDLE**
  (`~/repos/lean-surfaces-backup/…-20260814-….bundle`); the live remote is
  `github`. A lane that seeds a clone with `cp -Rpc` (§7 A13) inherits BOTH
  remotes, and `git reset --hard origin/master` silently lands it on
  2026-08-14 — a tree where this lane's own four landings do not exist. It
  also makes `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/master` report `0` while the
  clone is a week behind, and makes a feature branch look "238 commits ahead
  of master". **Check `git remote -v` after seeding, and reset to
  `github/master`.**
* **A seeded clone inherits the seed's BRANCH.** `lean-es` was on `master`,
  but the first seed attempt (`lean-pyc2` from an earlier `lean-es`) came up
  on `pyrebuild-monadic`. Verify `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` before
  building — a triad run on the wrong branch verifies nothing about master,
  and this lane spent one whole tenure discovering that.
* **Push on the FIRST green triad, before any fetch-rebase.** The verified
  state at first green is a landing; holding it for a post-rebase
  re-verification converts a landing into an exposure. Rebase and re-verify
  after the push.
* **Killing an out-of-tenure build costs almost nothing** — lake caches
  completed modules, so a killed build resumes where it stopped. Nobody
  should hesitate to kill their own build to protect the machine.

### Battery

`Examples/python/dict_lab` gains 17 functions / 33 `cases.json` rows: the
ORDER-observing rows (insertion order out of sort order, an overwrite keeping
its ORIGINAL position, `list(d)[0]`), every consumer, the empty-dict `max`
`ValueError` through the shared arm, non-int keys through the generic ordering
path, the `True`/`1` key-collision rule, the empty dict, and the still-loud
live cursor. Census: six `dict.*` witnesses flip REFUSE → MATCH.

## 2026-08-22-pycomplete-2 — the §9.4 DIVERGE/DIVERGED violation, closed

`harness/library_survey.py` emitted the family's failure verdict under two
names. The Go lane pinned the mechanism exactly — a deliberate rename at the
EMISSION BOUNDARY (`row["verdict"] = "DIVERGED" if verdict == "DIVERGE" else
verdict`) sitting downstream of eleven sites that already produced the
canonical `DIVERGE` — so the fix was mechanical rather than a redesign.

Eight sites: the translation is deleted, the direct set and its detail string
say `DIVERGE`, and the six consumers keyed on the drifted name follow it —
scoreboard order, the title/verdict pairing (which was `("DIVERGED",
"DIVERGED")`, a display title and a selector that had drifted TOGETHER, so
neither half revealed the other), and both exit gates.

**§5.4 both-directions discipline verified, not assumed**: both gates read
`return 1 if (counts.get("DIVERGE") or counts.get("INCOMPLETE")) else 0` — they
fail on a divergence or an unfinished battery and pass otherwise, and they now
key on the same string the 18 emission sites produce. Before the fix the gates
keyed on `DIVERGED`, which only worked because the boundary translation fed
them; delete that translation alone and the gates would have gone silent. The
two halves had to move together, which is why the audit's "one emits both" row
was the right tell.

`harness/library_oracle.py`'s `DIVERGED` is prose in a comment, not an
emission; normalized anyway so the vocabulary is single-valued in `harness/`.
`docs/duplication-audit.md`'s row is updated to record the fix rather than
left asserting a defect that no longer exists.
